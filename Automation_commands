# Find IP Address from list of subdomains

# GNU parallel, you can run multiple whatweb scans simultaneously,
     ```cat http_200.txt | parallel whatweb {}```
    
    # Explanation:
    - cat http_200.txt outputs all URLs.
    - parallel whatweb {} runs whatweb on each line ({} is replaced by the URL).
    - By default, parallel runs as many jobs as you have CPU cores.
    
    # Limit the number of concurrent jobs
      ```cat http_200.txt | parallel -j 10 whatweb {}```
      -j 10 limits it to 10 simultaneous scans (adjust based on your CPU/network).
    # Show which URL is being scanned
      - cat http_200.txt | parallel --tag whatweb {}
     - --tag prefixes the output with the URL, so you know which result belongs to which target.
    # Save output to a file
      ```cat http_200.txt | parallel --tag whatweb {} > whatweb_results.txt```
      - All results are saved in whatweb_results.txt for later analysis.
